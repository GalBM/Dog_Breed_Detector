Convolutional Neural Networks
Project: Write an Algorithm for a Dog Identification App

goal:
get experience in buildning CNN and using transfer learning to build CNN model. the project engage in predict\recognize breed
accoding to dog pictures.

libaries:
numpy, sklearnm glob, random, cv2, matplolib, keras, tqdm, PIL, extract_bottleneck_features.

database: 
using resnet database

CNN pretrained model:
resnet-50, VGG-16


File description:
test_model - folder with 6 personal image to test the model
dog_app.html - html of jupyter notebook
dog_app.py - script of the project
